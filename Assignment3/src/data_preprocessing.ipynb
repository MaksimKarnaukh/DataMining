Anticipating mixed reactions, the rupee seems unaffected, persisting within the broad range of 83.30-83.45,” Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst at LKP Securities, said.\\nMeanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.28 per cent lower at 103.41 on Tuesday.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nBrent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, advanced 0.34 per cent to USD 76.29 per barrel.\\nOn the domestic equity market front, the 30-share benchmark BSE Sensex plunged 377.50 points, or 0.54 per cent, to settle at 69,551.03 points. The Nifty also fell 90.70 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 20,906.40 points.\\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net buyers in the capital market on Monday as they bought shares worth Rs 1,261.13 crore, according to exchange data.'"
